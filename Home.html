<font size="3" face= "Arial">Welcome to this comprehensive resource, dedicated to shedding light on the military's deployment of drones in combat scenarios and assessing the implications for civilian security. We believe that citizens have the right to understand how drones effect modern warfare. Therefore, we present to you an exploration of this topic, designed to enhance your understanding.

<p><font size="3" face= "Arial">Warfare has always been a complex and dangerous process, often putting countless human lives at risk. For a long time, human presence on the battlefield was deemed essential for combat operations. A critical aspect of modern warfare revolves around aircraft units. However, the cost of losing pilots in battle is high, both in terms of human lives and resources. In response to this challenge, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as military drones, has emerged as a promising solution. These machines can perform missions in hostile environments without endangering human lives. In this report, we will delve into the world of military drone technology to understand how it can save lives and the types of drone technology currently in use.</font></p>

<h3><font size="5" face= "Courier">The difference between civilian and military drones</font></h3>

<p align="left" style="width: 100%;" ><font size="3" face= "Arial">Military drones demand an exceptionally high level of reliability, given their crucial roles in missions related to national security and lifesaving endeavours. These missions are meticulously planned and can be quite lengthy, necessitating military drones with extended endurance flight times, typically exceeding 60 minutes.
<br/><br/>
 In contrast to their commercial counterparts, military drones must operate covertly and stealthily, designed to remain inconspicuous during their operations. They are operated using sophisticated ground control units, which not only provide live video feeds but also enable the marking of targets on maps to guide ground forces and offer various specialized operational features. 
 <br/><br/>
 Security is paramount, as data sent from military drones to ground stations requires robust encryption to safeguard sensitive information. Moreover, military drones must withstand GPS and communication jamming, ensuring their continued functionality even in challenging environments. Additionally, military drones are part of a comprehensive system that includes a ground control unit and a designated carrying unit, allowing for safe transportation in rough terrains and facilitating quick deployment in the field. This stands in contrast to commercial drones, where these considerations are often less emphasized, and deployment procedures tend to be slower and more complex.</font>

<h3><font size="5" face= "Courier">South Africa's Drone</font></h3>

<img src="Milkor.JPG" align ="left" valign ="middle" width="40%" height="50%" alt="image" class="image-with-border"/>

<p align="left" style="width:40%-100%;" ><font size="3" face= "Arial">The Milkor 380, a large drone with a big wingspan and the ability to carry a lot of equipment, successfully flew for the first time on September 19, according to a DefenseWeb article from October 10. This is a significant achievement, as South Africa is one of the few countries in the world to create and fly a drone of this size.
<br/><br/>
The drone project started in 2018 and has been testing on the ground this year. It's made entirely in South Africa and has advanced technology for military use. It's designed for long surveillance missions, can carry heavy equipment, and is powered by a powerful engine, allowing it to fly high and relatively fast.
<br/><br/>
This drone will be a valuable asset for law enforcement and defense in South Africa. It comes at a time when drones are being used more for surveillance in Africa, especially in conflict areas like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. South Africa is leading the way in this technology, and other African countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya, and more are also using drones for military purposes.
<br/><br/>
In 2022, the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee introduced a plan to prevent terrorists from using drones. This involves better monitoring of sales of sensitive materials and technologies used in drones' construction.
<br/><br/>
The Milkor 380's launch is expected to boost South Africa's drone industry, and there are plans to use it domestically. African countries are increasing their defense budgets to improve their military capabilities, with Nigeria as an example, which significantly raised its military spending.
<br/><br/>
The drone will continue testing in 2023, with public demonstrations planned for 2024 during the African Aerospace and Defense Exhibition.</font></p>
