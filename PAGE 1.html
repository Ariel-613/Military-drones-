It is powered by a Honeywell TPE331-10GD turboprop engine, capable of producing up to 900 shaft horsepower, resulting in a cruise speed of around 230 mph (equivalent to 200 knots). With a fuel capacity of 602 gallons, the drone can cover a range of 1,150 miles. It is capable of sustained flight at its maximum altitude of 50,000 feet for over 27 hours, conducting surveillance using advanced cameras, sensors, and radar. Moreover, the Reaper can carry a payload of up to 3,750 pounds, including various attack weapons.</font></p></td></tr>

<td><p><font size="4" face= "Arial">The Bayraktar Kizilelma Fighter, developed by Baykar in Turkey, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known for its advanced maneuverability and stealthy design that makes it less susceptible to radar detection. Weighing 8.5 tons, including 1.5 tons of ordnance, and resembling a compact, pilotless fighter jet, it is powered by a Ukrainian Al-25T turbofan engine from Motor Sich. This UAV can achieve cruising speeds between 0.6 Mach and a maximum of 0.9 Mach, operating at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet with a combat radius of 500 nautical miles and a five-hour flight duration. It possesses a low radar cross-section (RCS), advanced situational awareness thanks to its Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, and the capability for fully autonomous takeoff and landing. The Kizilema is equipped for both air-to-ground and air-to-air missions, and there are plans for the development of two supersonic variants using Ukrainian Ivchenko-Progress AI-322 afterburning engines.</font></p></td></tr>

Among its widely exported UAVs, the Bayraktar TB2 stands out for its impressive array of features compactly packed into a lightweight design. Notably, as it's developed in a NATO member nation, it adheres to at least some NATO operational standards, making it appealing to the 30 member states within the alliance. Recognizable by its distinctive inverted V-tail, the TB2 has garnered attention for its utilization by the Ukrainian Armed Forces during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian conflict.</font></p></td></tr>

It falls under the class of loitering munitions, a relatively recent and highly effective type of unmanned vehicle, often referred to by its manufacturer as a loitering missile. These drones are designed for targeting beyond visual range and are launched from lightweight, portable tubes that can be easily carried in a backpack and deployed within minutes. Once in flight, users can control the vehicle for up to ten minutes using a tablet-style controller with a camera feed from the drone. The Switchblade can either explode on impact or be repurposed for reconnaissance and safely recalled if a mission is aborted.</font></p></td></tr>
